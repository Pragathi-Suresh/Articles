# Programming

#### Introduction

There is a lot of myth going on around Programming language. People consider that Programming language is difficult to learn and it is complex to understand by the comman people unless you are good at math. Well, it's partially true but not completely. Everything is based upon the person's interest and view towards the Prgramming Language. It is not necessary to be intelligent to understand Programming but it is important to understand the concepts and logic of Programming.

Many think that Programming language should be learned right from high school. Yes, early start is important step in learning Programming but people from non-techincal background also learn Programming language even after their graduation to alternate their path for better career options. It is all about passion and determination of an individual to learn things. With that said, we may go in detail about Programming.

#### What is Programming?
There are countless defintion and meaning for Programming, but in simple **Programming is northing but a set activities that are executed in a pre-defined manner to achive the defined goal or a task.** Inother words, Programming is how you instruct the computer to solve a problem.

Many think that Programming is only realted to computer activities. But in reality, it is used in our day-to-day activities or any event.
For instance, 
- Planning for a family vaccation
- Organising an event
- Setting up goals and deadlines for a project is also a part of planning. 
All these instance requires one main thing that is to have a structured plan or defined set of activites to ensure that the outcomes are favourable without any complications or struggles.


#### Basic constructs of Programming

Now we move on to the next topic in understanding the Programming in detail. The three basic constructs of Programming is Sequence, Selection and Iteration.
Constructs of programming is northing but the concepts or building blocks which is used to define program.

##### Sequence
Sequence is the order in which the programming statements are executed. These are programmed to run after one other in an order unless other constructs are used.
Sequence is extremely important because once the program is translated it will carry on the instructions. If it is wrongly programmed or the logic given is wrong it creates misfunction and gives out wrong instructions which leads to a progrom perform ineffectively.

Let's us consider the example of signing up for any social media. The First step for signing up is to fill in the required details for opening an account. 
If the Programmer has coded or in other words given the instructions to store the data accordingly it will carry on to the next step to give a register Id and allows him/her to

setup a password. And if the programmer had given wrong instructions it will affect the whole login process. Hence these are corrected at the early stages in developing a program. 

##### Branching / Selection
Selection is a programming construct where a code is activated only if a conditions mentioned in the program. Selection is a part of decision making and it determines the path of the programming. Let's us continue with the previous example, Once we complete the sign up process, the next step is to assign a user ID and password.

The programm will gives us few choices based upon the details filled in the signup form and we can either choose them or can create our own ID. After that we can create our password. Setting up a secured password is necessity and the programmer will setup few conditions and only if the conditions are met the user will be able to create one. So this selection programming done to secure the customers Account.

##### Iteration
Iteration is often refered to as Looping since the program get back to its original line of code. Iteration means repeating, and certain programs are required to repeat unitil it is coded to stop or the conditions are met. Iteration helps in keeping the programms as simple as possible. Thus making the program as effective as possible. Here the programmer will type the code once and set them to repeat infinite times unless it is stoped. This reduces the workload as the programmer need not type the same lines again and again.
                For example, Login and Logout is a continous process. Certain softwares are logged out automatically when it is inactive or not in use for security reasons. Hence these are contious process and these are coded in simple way to reapeat the action and avoid complextiy.
